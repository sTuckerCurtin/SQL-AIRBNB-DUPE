-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< EXAMPLE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- TODO: Remove the "--" from the below SELECT query and run the query
--    NOTE: When writing queries, make sure each one ends with a semi-colon

-- SELECT * FROM final_airbnb;



-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 1 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out how many rows are in the table "final_airbnb"
-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 146

-- SELECT count(*) as row_count FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb;

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 2 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out the name of the host for "host_id" 63613
-- HINT: "Where" could it be?

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Patricia

-- SELECT host_name, host_id FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb
-- -- where host_id like "63613" ;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 3 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to just show the unique neighbourhoods listed
-- HINT: This is a "distinct" operation...

-- SELECT distinct neighbourhood FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb;-- 

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 40 neighbourhoods listed


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 4 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

-- Find both the highest price listing and the lowest price listing, displaying the entire row for each
-- HINT: This can be two different queries.

-- FOOD FOR THOUGHT: Think about the results. Are the high and low prices outliers in this data set?


-- SELECT MAX(price) as max_price, min(price) as lowest_price FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb;


-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Highest = 785, Lowest = 55


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 5 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the average availability for all listings in the data set (using the availability_365 column)
-- HINT: Aggregates are more than just big rocks...

-- SELECT AVG(availability_365) as average_avail FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 165.3904


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 6 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find all listings that do NOT have a review
-- HINT: There are a few ways to go about this. Remember that an empty cell is "no value", but not necessarily NULL

-- SELECT * FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb
-- where number_of_reviews = "0" ;

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 6 rows


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 7 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the id of the listing with a room_type of "Private room" that has the most reviews 
-- HINT: Sorting is your friend!


-- SELECT id, host_id, room_type, number_of_reviews FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb
-- where room_type = "Private Room" 
-- order by number_of_reviews desc
-- limit 1;


-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 8 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the most popular neighbourhood for listings 
-- HINT: Look for which neighbourhood appears most frequently in the neighbourhood column
-- HINT: You are creating "summary rows" for each neighbourhood, so you will just see one entry for each neighbourhood

-- SELECT distinct neighbourhood, count(*) as popular_listing FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb
-- group by neighbourhood
-- order by popular_listing desc ;



-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: Williamsburg
-- INVESTIGATE: Should Williamsburg be crowned the most popular neighbourhood?
-- It could be argued that south slope could be the most popular due to low availability and a high amount of reviews

-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 9 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Query the data to discover which listing is the most popular using the reviews_per_month for all listings with a minimum_nights value of less than 7
-- HINT: Sorting is still your friend! So are constraints.

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: 58059


-- SELECT * FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb
-- where minimum_nights < 7
-- order by number_of_reviews desc
-- limit 1;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 10 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find out which host has the most listings. 
-- Create a NEW column that will show a calculation for how many listings the host for each listing has in the table
-- Display the column using aliasing.
-- HINT: Work this one step at a time. See if you can find a way to just display the count of listings per host first.

-- EXPECTED OUTPUT: The Box House Hotel with 6 listings



-- SELECT host_name, count(*) as listing_count FROM intro_sql.final_airbnb
-- group by host_name
-- order by listing_count desc
-- limit 1;


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< PROBLEM 11 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< WRAP UP >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? What factors seem to be at play the most?
-- Write a few sentences and include them with your project submission in the README file 


-- <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< ** BONUS ** >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
-- Find the the percent above or below each listing is compared to the average price for all listings.
-- HINT: No hints! It's a bonus for a reason :)
